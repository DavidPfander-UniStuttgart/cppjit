Essential:
- make trivial build system configurable
- improve API for non-inline-sourced kernels
- add cmake support for kernels (for arbitrarily complex kernels and other compilers)

Important:
- support declar macro that support placement in specific namespace
- support for c++ symbols
- support for multi-symbol libraries
- examples
- add meaningful error messages
- github description

Nice:
- tests
- loading objects? (waiting for usecase)
