- make trivial build system configurable
- improve API for non-inline-sourced kernels
- add cmake support for kernels (for arbitrarily complex kernels and other compilers)

Important:
- support declare macro that support placement in specific namespace
- support for c++ symbols- CHECK
- support for multi-symbol libraries - CHECK, via loading a class
- examples - IN PROGRESS
- add meaningful error messages - CHECK
- github description

Nice:
